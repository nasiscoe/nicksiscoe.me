        <h1>Nick Siscoe</h1>
        <p>I am a software developer with an impetus for building new things that people want.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am trying to eliminate the financial stressors of college students <strong>@Findo</strong> alongside wrapping up an Amazon Alexa project as a product manager for <strong>@Tigerpaw Software</strong> and working on a website for the <strong>@Raikes School</strong> at UNL.
      </header>
      <p>Most notably, my previous development experiences include engineering software for 98% of American high school football coaches as an intern <strong>@Hudl</strong> and interning <strong>@PayIt</strong> while the company had just under 35 employees. PayIt has since raised over $100M.</p>
      <p>I have worked on a number of personal projects, including a daily writing web-app called <strong>@DayPaper</strong>, an influencer monetization platform called <strong>@SponsorWhale</strong>, and even a mobile game called <strong>@Munchy</strong>.</p>
